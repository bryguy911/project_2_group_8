In this project, we analyzed crowdfunding campaign data to find trends and patterns. Using Python, we cleaned messy data, fixing dates, splitting categories, and formatting numbers, before organizing it into a structured database for an easier analysis.

Our findings showed which campaign categories were most popular, the success and failure rates of campaigns, and the countries with the most activity. We used bar graphs and pie charts to make these trends clear and easy to understand.

This project highlighted how organizing and analyzing data can provide valuable insights and gave us ideas for future improvements, such as breaking down categories into subcategories, to see which subcategories produced more successes / failures.
